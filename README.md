# MODULE 20 CHALLENGE : Joint Savings Account Smart Contract in Solidity

For this challenge assignment we are working as a new hire at a fintech startup company. The company is building smart contracts to automate many of the firms processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts. Inorder to automate the creation of joint savings accounts, we need to creat a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

In this challenge we will be working with solidity, Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.
