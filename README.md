# MODULE 20 CHALLENGE : Joint Savings Account Smart Contract in Solidity

For this challenge assignment we are working as a new hire at a fintech startup company. The company is building smart contracts to automate many of the firms processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts. Inorder to automate the creation of joint savings accounts, we need to creat a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

In this challenge we will be working with solidity 
 

In this challenge assignment we will generate a new Ethereum account instance by using the mnemonic seed phrase provided by Ganache, fetch and display the account balance associated with our Ethereum account address, calculate the total value of an Ethereum transaction(including gas estimations, that pay the candidate for their work), digitally sign a transaction that pays the Fintech Finder Candidate and send the tansaction to the Ganashe Blockchain, and review the transaction hash code aassociated with the validated blockchain transaction.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) - This program allows for the creation of web apps from python code.

* [Web3](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/v5/) -This module allows for the interaction of Ethereum and to help with sending transactions, interacting with smart contracts, reading block data, and a variety of other use cases.
